Marco Rubio, R-Fla., must submit an unclassified report on unidentified aerial phenomena to Congress.","It comes as several erstwhile officials, including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and two former CIA directors, have called for a more rigorous look at these sightings.","The most famous example (the one Musk was asked about) occurred when Navy pilots reported a craft resembling a Tic Tac that was moving unlike anything seen in the U.S. arsenal: They said it “wasn’t behaving by the normal laws of physics.”","The craft’s movements were, however, typical of both military and civilian UFO reports: Descending from 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet in an instant; stopping in midair and reversing direction without inertial effects; exceeding the speed of sound without generating a sonic boom; and submerging into the ocean.","After The New York Times and The Washington Post reported on it in 2017 along with the military’s secret UFO tracking program, the Pentagon publicly acknowledged last year that the leaked videos in the stories were authentic.","Now recently retired national security officials are speaking out.","In the run-up to the task force’s report in June, John Ratcliffe, former director of national intelligence, told Fox News last month that there were “a lot more sightings than have been made public.”","Similarly, James Woolsey, former director of the CIA, said on a podcast this month he was taking the subject seriously, as did a successor at the CIA, John Brennan, in December.","The Pentagon hasn’t offered an official explanation for UAPs like the Tic Tac craft, calling them “unidentified.”","Former officials don’t seem to be willing to utter the word “alien,” but it’s the implication of what they do say.","Lue Elizondo, who ran the secret Pentagon UFO tracking unit, has publicly ruled out the theory that the Tic Tac craft came from the U.S. arsenal or from the arsenals of our adversaries, leaving only the theory that it came from “someone or something else.”","According to Brennan, some of the phenomena we’re seeing “could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life.”","U.S. Navy pilots who have actually seen the Tic Tac craft are even more direct, with one telling the Post it was “Something not from the Earth.”","While it’s good that the government is finally taking UFOs more seriously, its job is primarily to figure out whether they represent a military threat.","But these unidentified objects may also represent an opportunity to advance our science and technology significantly — if our other two pillars of innovation, academia and industry, are willing to catch up.","Unfortunately, when scientists are asked about UFOs, they generally laugh off the subject.","The well-known astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, for one, said he would only take the idea seriously when aliens send him a dinner invite.","Why do leading scientists show such a profound lack of curiosity in a subject that might redefine not just their fields, but also all of science?","It could lead to a new understanding of our place in the universe, and new advances in materials science, biology, quantum physics, cosmology and social sciences.","Part of the problem likely stems from an academic version of the old IBM rule in industry that “No one ever gets fired for buying IBM.”","Similarly, no professor ever gets fired for mocking UFOs.","The case of Harvard Medical School’s Dr. John Mack, though, shows the dangers if you don’t.","Thankfully, small cracks are appearing in academia’s wall of mockery.","Avi Loeb, chief astronomer at Harvard University, was willing to say in his new book, “Extraterrestrial,” that he thinks that ‘Oumuamua, the first object we have spotted in the night sky whose origin is definitely from outside our solar system, was most likely a technological artifact of a long-vanished alien civilization.","Most academics, though, still invoke some version of Musk’s nonargument: “If aliens were here, we would know!”","But the government is saying that it does know: These craft exist.","My purpose today is not to convince you of the evidence, however, but to encourage academics and industry leaders to move beyond their biases into an open-minded investigation to figure out who or what created them, and how they work.","I’m not naïve enough to assume that academics will study UFOs just to further human knowledge.","But to point out the obvious: In the long term, there could be multiple Nobel prizes, not to mention new laws of physics, for those who are willing to dive in and risk ridicule in the short term.","Scientists in Europe who dismissed the idea of rocks falling out of the sky eventually opened their minds enough to discover meteorites — ending up with a more complex understanding of the universe.","The results this time could lead to new kinds of transportation devices capable of submerging into the ocean and in the air, transporting cargo and passengers across the globe in minutes, as well as ferrying humans safely beyond planet Earth.","Similar rewards await industry risk-takers as well, especially innovators in Silicon Valley who are interested in speculative topics such as the Singularity and the Simulation Hypothesis.","To some extent, their apathy is the predictable spillover effect from the ivory tower: Venture capital firms aren’t going to invest in something that academics haven’t stamped as “viable” technology.","But peer pressure may also be at work here, too.","Businessman Joe Firmage, for instance, was once the toast of the valley only to resign so as not to hurt his company’s reputation after speaking of his interest in UFOs (and being skewered as “the Fox Mulder of Silicon Valley” in the press).","Despite the risks, there are some encouraging signs.","Recently, Prof. Garry Nolan of Stanford University and Jacques Vallee, a venture capitalist who worked with J. Allen Hynek — a part of the Air Force’s first UFO investigation group, Project Blue Book, from 1947-1969 — have teamed up to investigate samples of materials supposedly ejected at purported UFO landing sites.","My purpose today is not to convince you of the evidence, but to encourage academics and industry leaders to move beyond their biases into an open-minded investigation.","As a starting point, if the ratios of the metals’ specific isotopes don’t naturally occur on Earth, the chemical composition could open up new opportunities for high-performance craft materials on- and off-planet.","Vallee (inspiration for the French scientist in director Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”) told me they would go through the academic peer-review processes, which might greatly advance respect for the subject.","Where does this leave us?","We will know more when the Pentagon’s report on unidentified aerial phenomena comes out in June, but now that the government is starting to take UFOs seriously, it’s high time that more academics and industry leaders step up to do the same."

Trump.”","While the page includes a dramatic video claiming, “A BEACON OF FREEDOM ARISES” and hailing “A PLACE TO SPEAK FREELY AND SAFELY,” the page is little more than a displays of Trump’s recent statements — available elsewhere on the website — that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter, the platforms that banished him after the riot.","While Trump aides have spent months teasing his plans to launch his own social media platform, his spokesman Jason Miller said the blog was something separate.","“President Trump’s website is a great resource to find his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office, but this is not a new social media platform,” he tweeted. “","We’ll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.”","Barred from social media, Trump has embraced other platforms for getting his message out.","He does frequent interviews with friendly news outlets and has emailed a flurry of statements to reporters through his official office and political group.","Trump has even said he prefers the statements to his old tweets, often describing them as more “elegant.”","Facebook created the oversight panel to rule on thorny content on its platforms following widespread criticism of its difficulty responding swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns.","Its decisions so far — all nine of them — have tended to favor free expression over the restriction of content.","In its first rulings, the panel overturned four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable material.","It ordered Facebook to restore posts by users that the company said broke standards on adult nudity, hate speech, or dangerous individuals.","Critics of Facebook, however, worry that the Oversight Board is a mere distraction from the company’s deeper problems — ones that can’t be addressed in a handful of high-profile cases by a semi-independent body of experts.","“Facebook set the rules, are judge, jury and executioner and control their own appeals court and their own Supreme Court.","The decisions they make have an impact on our democracies, national security and biosecurity and cannot be left to their own in house theatre of the absurd,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit critical of Facebook. “","Whatever the judgement tomorrow, this whole fiasco shows why we need democratic regulation of Big Tech.”","Gautam Hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at Vanderbilt University, said he finds the Oversight Board structure to be “frustrating and a bit of a sideshow from the larger policy and social questions that we have about these companies.”","“To some degree, Facebook is trying to create an accountability mechanism that I think undermines efforts to have government regulation and legislation,” Hans said. “","If any other company decided, well, we’re just going to outsource our decision-making to some quasi-independent body, that would be thought of as ridiculous.”","__","Associated Press Writer Jill Colvin contributed to this story.","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*","*"

question are big factors when assessing the need for travel insurance.","Please click on this sentence.","As vaccinations rise and restrictions ease, more and more Americans are making travel plans for the summer and beyond.","But many are proceeding with caution amid the lingering uncertainty about the future of COVID-19 and memories of frantic trip cancellations in 2020 ― hence the increasing interest in travel insurance.","Please do NOT click on this sentence.","“Travel insurance is being seen more as an essential coverage,” Amy Danise, chief insurance analyst at Forbes Advisor, told HuffPost. “","The pandemic showed us how unpredictable travel can be.","Frankly, travel has always been unpredictable ― after all, you don’t expect that you’re going to get injured or ill before or during a trip.","Please click on this sentence.","But the pandemic put a spotlight on ways we can increase our financial security, and travel insurance certainly fits that bill.”","People were quick to buy travel insurance as the coronavirus situation escalated last February, and the interest has continued.","But is travel insurance actually worth it now?","Below, Danise and other experts share their guidance.","Consider the trip in question","Your personal financial situation and the amount you’re splurging on the trip in question are big factors when assessing the need for travel insurance.","“If you have just dropped a large amount of money on non-refundable trip deposits, travel insurance is already a necessity for you ― unless you can easily afford to lose that money if something goes wrong,” Danise noted.","“On the flip side, if you’re staying in the U.S. and you have refundable airline tickets and a hotel with a good cancellation policy, you may not need travel insurance because you don’t have much to lose,” she added.","Make sure the plan covers what you want","If you do decide to purchase travel insurance, it’s important to read the details before committing to a particular plan.","“The biggest mistake that people regularly make with insurance is buying it with just a hope that it’ll be useful and protective, but only looking at the fine print when they actually need to use it,” said Scott Keyes, author of “Take More Vacations” and founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights. “","It’s all well and good to buy things to give us comfort and peace of mind, but it’s important to recognize if you actually need to use this product, it might not be as protective or expansive as you assumed.”","Many people learned early in the pandemic that their travel insurance didn’t necessarily cover flights or accommodations they canceled due to concerns about the coronavirus because they hadn’t purchased “cancel for any reason” plans.","As the name suggests, this type of insurance allows travelers to cancel their trips for any reason, including fear.","Naturally, the pandemic increased interest in this benefit.","Last week, the travel insurance company Seven Corners reported a 180% increase in sales of “cancel for any reason” insurance plans in 2020 compared with 2019 and noted that this upward trend has continued into 2021.","“Unless you get ‘cancel for any reason’ insurance, travel insurance is mostly worthless for pandemic-related circumstances,” said Konrad Waliszewski, co-founder and CEO of the travel app Tripscout. “","It can still certainly help for all the typical pre-pandemic related issues, such as sickness, injury, or common airline cancellations, but it’s unlikely any of the covered reasons will help you with the recent added uncertainty of traveling in the world of COVID-19.”","See how you’re already covered","In some cases, your travel concerns may already be covered without the need to purchase insurance.","“Be cognizant of what is covered from the beginning,” Keyes noted. “","I get the sense that people under-account for how much protection they already have without having to buy anything extra.","The things people worry about ― what happens if there’s a big delay, if the flight gets canceled, if my bag gets lost ― generally speaking if those things happen, the airline itself will give you compensation if you reach out and ask.","It varies but it’s not as if anything can happen to you and you’re left completely on your own.”","He added that many credit cards also carry some form of travel protection, so the card you used to pay for your flight may cover you or offer some amount of money to buy a new flight or a new bag and clothes if yours was lost.","“Find out the ways you’re already protected and then, with that in mind, ask, ‘Is it worth it for me to buy extra?","Are there other things I’m concerned about?’”","Keyes suggested.","Don’t forget about travel medical insurance","Travel insurance isn’t just about covering flights, accommodations or activities.","If you’re concerned about health and safety amid the pandemic, you may want to invest in travel medical insurance.","This is more often a consideration with international trips.","“If you’re traveling outside the U.S., travel medical insurance is a necessity,” Danise said. “","That’s because U.S. health plans and Medicare generally have little or no coverage outside the U.S. You simply don’t want to be traveling abroad without the safety net of medical coverage.”","Take advantage of your coverage","If you decide to buy travel insurance, it’s important to familiarize yourself with everything it entails to ensure you get your money’s worth.","“People may not realize the range of problems that travel insurance can cover ― from trip cancellation to medical expenses to lost baggage,” Danise said, adding that travel insurance may also cover the hotel room, meals or toiletries you need to buy if you wind up stuck somewhere due to a flight delay.","*","*","*","*","*","*"
