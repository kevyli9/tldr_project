Facebook wiped out pages from australian state governments and charities as well as from domestic and international news organisations, three days before the launch of a nationwide covid-19 vaccination programme. Though the measure was limited to australia, european publishers along with british and canadian politicians described the measure as an attempt to put pressure on governments that might consider similar measures. “facebook’s actions to unfriend australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as facebook’s actions to unfriend australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services were disappointing,” australian prime minister scott morrison wrote on australian prime minister scott morrison own facebook page. Canadian heritage minister steven guilbeault, who is drafting legislation to make the platforms pay for using media content, said facebook’s move was “highly irresponsible.”. “it won’t deter us from moving ahead,” he said in remarks to reporters. The dispute centres on a planned australian law that would require facebook and alphabet incfacebook’s google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to whose links platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration. A facebook spokeswoman said that ceo mark zuckerberg had “a constructive call with australian treasurer josh frydenberg and again expressed ceo mark zuckerberg disappointment with the proposed law.”. A facebook spokeswoman said facebook would continue to engage with the governments on amendments to the proposed law. Facebook said facebook had blocked a wide swathe of pages because the proposed law did not clearly define news content. Facebook said facebook commitment to combat misinformation had not changed, and facebook would restore pages that were taken down by mistake. Facebook used facebook machine learning tools to identify news on the site to enforce the australia action that blocked everything from news and government websites to facebook own site in australia at one point. “there is willful blindness to this logic,” evans wrote in a blog post on wednesday.

Facebook’s action in australia had campaigned together against such laws and both threatened to cancel services in australia, but google sealed pre-emptive deals with several media outlets in recent days.

https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/u-s-military-takes-ufos-seriously-why-doesn-t-silicon-ncna1264107,The U.S. military takes UFOs seriously. Why doesn't Silicon Valley or academia?," In our era of life-changing innovation, there are major breakthroughs that could well come from the serious study of a phenomenon we too often mock: ufos. The government has reversed the government official position of publicly ignoring uaps (unidentified aerial phenomenon, the new trendy name for ufos) and is starting to tackle the subject openly. But within academia and industry, the topic is still too frequently dismissed with a chuckle accompanied by some trite remark about “extraterrestrials.”. In february, for instance, one of the biggest innovators of this century, elon musk, was asked what elon musk thought about the recent pentagon acknowledgment that navy pilots have seen objects flying in our airspace using advanced technology we can’t identify, let alone understand or explain or reproduce. An unclassified report on unidentified aerial phenomena to congress comes as several erstwhile officials, including former senate majority leader harry reid and two former cia directors, have called for a more rigorous look at these sightings. Now recently retired national security officials are speaking out. The pentagon the pentagon hasn’t offered an official explanation for uaps like the tic tac craft, calling the pentagon “unidentified.”. Former officials don’t seem to be willing to utter the word “alien,” but the word’s the implication of what former officials do say. Lue elizondo, who ran the secret the pentagon ufo tracking unit, has publicly ruled out the theory that the tic tac craft came from the u.s. arsenal or from the arsenals of our adversaries, leaving only the theory that it came from “someone or something else.”. While it’s good that the government is finally taking ufos more seriously, the government job is primarily to figure out whether ufos represent a military threat. Unfortunately, when scientists are asked about ufos, scientists generally laugh off the subject. Why do leading scientists show such a profound lack of curiosity in a subject that might redefine not just leading scientists fields, but also all of science? It could lead to a new understanding of our place in the universe, and new advances in materials science, biology, quantum physics, cosmology and social sciences. Similarly, no professor ever gets fired for mocking ufos. The case of harvard medical school’s dr. john mack, though, shows the dangers if you don’t. Thankfully, small cracks are appearing in academia’s wall of mockery. Most academics, though, still invoke some version of musk’s nonargument: “if aliens were here, avi loeb, chief astronomer at harvard university would know!”. But the government is saying that the government does know: these craft exist. My purpose today is not to convince you of the evidence, however, but to encourage academics and industry leaders to move beyond academics and industry leaders biases into an open-minded investigation to figure out who or what created their biases, and how their biases work. Despite the risks, there are some encouraging signs.","The U.S. military takes UFOs seriously. The craft's movements were typical of both military and civilian UFO reports: Descending from 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet in an instant; stopping in midair and reversing direction without inertial effects; exceeding the speed of sound without generating a sonic boom; and submerging into the ocean. While it's good that the government is finally taking UFOs more seriously, its job is primarily to figure out whether they represent a military threat. Part of the problem likely stems from an academic version of the old IBM rule in industry that ”No one ever gets fired for buying IBM.” Similarly, no professor ever gets fired for mocking UFOs. I'm not naive enough to assume that academics will study UFOs just to further human knowledge. Recently, Prof. Garry Nolan of Stanford University and Jacques Vallee, a venture capitalist who worked with J. Allen Hynek - a part of the Air Force's first UFO investigation group, Project Blue Book, from 1947-1969 - have teamed up to investigate samples of materials supposedly ejected at purported UFO landing sites. We will know more when the Pentagon's report on unidentified aerial phenomena comes out in June, but now that the government is starting to take UFOs seriously, it's high time that more academics and industry leaders step up to do the same.","In our era of life-changing innovation, there are major breakthroughs that could well come from the serious study of a phenomenon we too often mock: UFOs.

Can elicit a broader range of responses and signal acceptance of something other than meeting pro forma societal expectations. Perhaps the best advice, though, is for all of us to be prepared for the fact that the pandemic has changed us. There wasn’t a one-size-fits-all response to the pandemic, nor will there be one for leaving social isolation.

If the company’s quasi-independent oversight board upholds facebook’s decision, former president donald trump’s will remain “indefinitely” suspended. Politicians, free speech experts and activists around the world are watching facebook’s decision closely. Facebook’s decision has implications not only for former president donald trump’s but for tech companies, world leaders and people across the political spectrum — many of whom have wildly conflicting views of the proper role for technology companies when it comes to regulating online speech and protecting people from abuse and misinformation. Former president donald trump’s does frequent interviews with friendly news outlets and has emailed a flurry of statements to reporters through former president donald trump’s official office and political group. Former president donald trump’s has even said former president donald trump’s prefers his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office to former president donald trump’s old tweets, often describing his old tweets as more “elegant.”. Facebook created the oversight panel to rule on thorny content on the oversight panel platforms following widespread criticism of the oversight panel difficulty responding swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns. In the oversight panel first rulings, the oversight panel overturned four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable material. “. Gautam hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at vanderbilt university, said gautam hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at vanderbilt university finds the oversight board structure to be “frustrating and a bit of a sideshow from the larger policy and social questions that we have about these companies.”. “to some degree, facebook is trying to create an accountability mechanism that i think undermines efforts to have government regulation and legislation,” hans said.","The company's quasi-independent Oversight Board will announce its ruling around 9 a.m. ET. If it rules in Trump's favor, Facebook has seven days to reinstate the account. If the board upholds Facebook's decision, Trump will remain ”Indefinitely” suspended. After years of handling Trump's inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram took the drastic step of silencing his accounts in January. In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing Trump to continue using the platform was too great. ”The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page on Jan. 7. A day before the announcement, Trump unveiled a new blog on his personal website, ”From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.” While the page includes a dramatic video claiming, ”A BEACON OF FREEDOM ARISES” and hailing ”A PLACE TO SPEAK FREELY AND SAFELY,” the page is little more than a displays of Trump's recent statements - available elsewhere on the website - that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter, the platforms that banished him after the riot. Critics of Facebook worry that the Oversight Board is a mere distraction from the company's deeper problems - ones that can't be addressed in a handful of high-profile cases by a semi-independent body of experts.","Since the day after the deadly Jan. 6 riots on the U.S. Capitol, former President Donald Trump’s social media accounts have been silent — muzzled for inciting violence using the platforms as online megaphones."

Your personal financial situation and the amount you’re splurging on the trip in question are big factors when assessing the need for travel insurance. “on the flip side, if you’re staying in the u.s. and you have refundable airline tickets and a hotel with a good cancellation policy, you may not need travel insurance because you don’t have much to lose,” she added. Make sure the plan covers what you want. “. Naturally, the pandemic increased interest in this benefit. “. “. The things people worry about ― what happens if there’s a big delay, if the flight gets canceled, if my bag gets lost ― generally speaking if those things happen, the airline itself will give you compensation if you reach out and ask. The airline itself varies but the airline itself’s not as if anything can happen to you and you’re left completely on your own.”.
