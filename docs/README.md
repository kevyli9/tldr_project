**Directions for TLDR HIT**  
Hi! You can access our HITs on Sandbox here: https://workersandbox.mturk.com/?filters%5Bsearch_term%5D=KL&page_size=20&page_number=1&sort=num_hits_desc&filters%5Bmin_reward%5D=0     

You can find the directions for our HIT below (alternatively, you can watch this video: https://vimeo.com/541313393)  

Our project is focused on summarizing news articles (hence, TLDR). For this HIT, you will be shown the text from an article and be asked to click on sentences that can be deleted while changing the meaning of the text as little as possible. Your goal is to summarize the text by deleting sentences that are not necessary to understand the main idea of the text.
* Please read the text first to get a sense of the main idea of the article before starting to click on sentences.
* There are attention checks embedded within the text ('Please click/do NOT click on this sentence')
* You must remove at least 5 sentences (5 not counting the attention checks)
* Feel free to leave feedback in the textbox at the bottom (we are particularly interested in whether or not the directions in the HIT itself, not these directions, are clear)  

Once you submit the HIT, you're done!
If you have any questions or if the HIT is not working properly, please contact kevyli@wharton.upenn.edu
